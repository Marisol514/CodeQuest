# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## My Task
```
At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, I’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment—perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.
```
## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Chriteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
